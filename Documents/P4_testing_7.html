			<h2>Testing document</h2>
			<p>
				We used a Google Form to get feedback from users. Most of the feedback was provided via this form, and some tests were conducted as live testing. We received a total of 23 feedbacks via the Google Form. The number of live tests were approximately 10. Our client was fictitious, and thusly no feedback was provided by them. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/140RO_cLC51d8RzstKRpHnoCig03o9KSsMiOq6sIUmrw/viewform?edit_requested=true">Here</a> is a link to the Google Form used.

			<h2>Tester audience</h2>
			<p>
				Our target demographics for the website were upper-class citizens. It was a bit difficult to reach the target audience for the feedback. We did however receive responses from a wide variety of people.
			</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td>Age</td>
						<td>18 or lower</td>
						<td>19-23</td>
						<td>24-29</td>
						<td>30-39</td>
						<td>40+</td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tody>
					<tr>
						<td>Testers</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>11</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>2</td>
					</tr>
				</tody>
			</table>
			<p>
				The tests were performed by friends and family. Because of this, most of the testers were of young age. The demographics of the live tests were similar to those of the Google Form shown above. 
			</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td>Profession</td>
						<td>High school student or lower</td>
						<td>Non-IT College student</td>
						<td>IT-College student</td>
						<td>Working in non-IT job</td>
						<td>Working in IT-job</td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Testers</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>11</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>1</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>
				Because the tests were performed by friends and family, most testers were either high school or college students. This means our testing audience was likely more proficient in technologies and websites than our intended target audience. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For future projects, we should try to reach the target audience as specified in e

			<h2>Testing platforms</h2>
			<p>
				We managed to reach a variety of platforms and browsers. Aside from the mobile-specific bugs, the responses were similar on all platforms and browsers.

			<table>

					<tr>
						<td>Platform</td>
						<td>Windows</td>
						<td>OS X</td>
						<td>Linux</td>
						<td>iOS</td>
						<td>Android</td>
					</tr>

			<h2>Feedback summary and response</h2>
			<p>
				Most of the feedback was very good. Users generally appreciated the overall professional look of the website. A particular feature users seemed to enjoy was the hijack-scrolling and the expanding menus. A few users made positive comments regarding the use of strong and specific colors for each season. One user said the website made them "hungry".
			</p>
			<p>
				We received some useful feedback regarding bugs on mobile platforms. One particular issue on mobile platforms was scrolling. After receiving feedback we added a media query for mobile devices and turned disabled hijack-scrolling for these devices. There was also a minor issue with responsiveness on the table reservation form. This was fixed after testing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One issue some users seemed to have was that they didn't understand they were supposed to scroll down from the front page. We intended to have a scroll indicator, represented by dots at the right side of the page, with the dot of the current page being highlighted. However, we encountered some problems with this and decided not to include it. This, or some other, scroll indicator would probably make it more obvious for the users that they were supposed to scroll. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We had forgotten to fill out the wine menus before starting testing. This was changed by a hotfix while tests were being conducted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another minor issue was that the text on the front page was a bit difficult to read on some monitor resolutions because the text appeared right in front of some of the very bright leaves. After testing we added a slightly transparent panel behind the text. If we were to work on this project further, we could maybe have been done better by setting how the background image would scale on different resolutions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some minor testing was done after these fixes were made. This feedback was only conducted via live testing, and no feedback was submitted by a new Google Form. This feedback was only positive, with no bugs or other negative feedback reported.

			<h2>Self-reflection</h2>
			<p>
				All of us have past experiences in web design and/or other programming, and expected to do quite well on this project. We have mostly accomplished what we intended, but we realized that working as a team is very different from working alone. Some of us had experience with git and version control, but not all. This resulted in a few merge conflicts and a lot of additional, unexpected work. Although we did plan ahead, quite comprehensively in fact, we also encountered some problems with the development itself. These issues were mostly related to javascript, which some of us had little or no past experience with. In hindsight, we may have been slightly too ambitious when planning the features of the website.
