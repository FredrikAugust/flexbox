        <h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
        <p>
          We're making a website for a fictional upper-class restaurant named
          Góðr fæða. The name of the website means 'good food' in Old Norse, and
          the restaurant serves traditional Norwegian food with high quality.
          The purpose of the website is to show off the restaurant, as well as
          let the user see the menu and reserve a table. The target audience is
          upper-class citizens who appreciate good food, hence our goal is to
          apply a minimalistic but yet extravagant design to the website.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Navigation structure</h2>
        <p>
          The website will be a one-page site, and there will not be a
          traditional navbar linking to other HTML files. Instead we will link
          to different sections of the index.html. The reason for choosing this
          approach is because the entire content of the website can easily fit
          inside one document, and opening separate pages would break the
          minimalistic immersion. Having separate pages would not increase the
          user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use <em>hijack-scrolling</em>[When the user scrolls the page
          moves one full view at the time] to make sure the page looks clean at
          all times. On the right side there will be a minimalistic scrollbar in
          the form of vertically aligned dots.  The scrollbar will highlight
          which part of the site the user is currently at, and it will allow the
          user to go directly to any part of the site like a normal navbar would
          do.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Page layout and appearance</h2>
        <p>
          When planning the design of the website we have focused on the target
          audience. We will apply an artistic theme to the website which gives a
          good first impression of both the website and the restaurant itself. A
          common problem with such simplistic designs is it may become a bit
          chaotic for the user to navigate throughout the website. Therefore, it
          is important that we find ways to make the website both artistic and
          intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front page will feature a <em>jumbotron</em>[A large block of
          content displaying the intent of the website.] of Norwegian nature. It
          will be a video of the forest with a still camera which will recorded
          by us. The video will be sped up to give a neat effect.  We will use a
          media query to replace the video with a still image on mobile devices
          to reduce mobile bandwidth usage and lower the loading time on
          possibly slow mobile networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the user scrolls down they get to the menu section. This will be
          split into four categories, represented by the four different seasons.
          When hovering over one category, the category expands horizontally
          slightly. When the user clicks a category it expands further and
          brings up a menu. We will add a media query to make the categories
          expand vertically instead of horizontally on vertically aligned mobile
          devices. The color of the font will be the average color of the season
          picture, and the background panel will be white and slightly
          transparent to make the text more readable. A wine chart may be
          brought up from the bottom by either clicking or dragging the button.
          The user must be able to get back to the main menu easily and
          intuitively with a back button.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next panel will be a table reservation page. Here the user
          provides name, number of people, a phone number and the desired date.
          This will be a very simplistic page with only a background, the panel
          and four input fields. The placeholder text of the input field will
          tell the user the type of input desired, which will disappear when the
          user starts typing. The color of the text will be gray to make the
          page look minimalistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last panel will be a footer with Google Maps integration and
          contact information (phone number and email address). Clicking on the
          map will open an external Google Maps website. The address will be a
          fictional one. The footer will not cover the whole page, to indicate
          that this is the end of the website.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Specific styling</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Background images: Each background image will cover the whole
              page, and vary depending on the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Font: The font must be modern and minimalistic. Thus we will use a
              sans serif font. The font used in the current sketch is called
              Poiret One, but this may be subject to change. The font sizes are
              not yet determined. However, since the amount of text on each page
              is fairly low, we will use a large text to fill the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Color scheme: Since the food will be based on four different
              seasons, we will use very distinctive colors for each menu to
              represent the specific season. As mentioned, the color of the font
              on each menu will be the average color of the season picture
              behind. For the rest of the pages the font color will be either
              white or gray depending on the background.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scroll indicator: As mentioned there will be a scroll indicator on
              the right with one dot for each page. The dot representing the
              current site will be highlighted by filling the dot. The scrollbar
              will essentially replace the navbar. Clicking on a dot will open
              the corresponding page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Logo: There will be a logo on the front page. So far we only have
              a sketch of the logo, and therefore the position and size of the
              logo, as well as the overall appearance of the front page are not
              yet fully determined. The logo will most likely be in the top left
              corner with the name of the restaurant centered on the page and
              aligned to the left with some padding.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Frontpage</h3>
          <p>
            This will be a simple page with a background video and some text
            displaying the name of the restaurant, as well as an introduction in
            the form of a short paragraph. The sole purpose of this frontpage is
            to set the theme for the rest of the website -- nature. This will be
            achieved by a tranquil nature video, as well as a focus on nature in
            the introductory paragraph. The text will be centered on the page, and
            aligned to the left side of the viewport, though with some padding.
            The video will be muted, autoplay, and put on repeat.
          </p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Season select</h3>
          <p>
            This is the <em>main content</em> of the website, this is where you
            select which season you would like to view the menu for.
          </p>
          <img src="./p2_images/season-select.png" alt="Picture of the season
          select page">
          <p>
            You can hover a season, and watch it expand slightly to indicate
            that it is being targeted. If you decide to click it, you will be
            taken to the next section, which is the "show season" part.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of the seasons will be 25% width upon first entering the view,
            but the hovered season will expand to take up ~35%, while the others
            decrease accordingly. This will give the user a feeling of
            responsiveness, and it will feel intuitive to click a season.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon clicking, it will expand to 85% width, and the others decrease
            to 5%, and the next view will be rendered.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Show season</h3>
          <p>
            Here you will be able to see the menu for the selected season. The
            thought is that you should be able to order a menu themed to a
            season in the restaurant. There will be a relatively small button on
            the bottom of the menu card to show the wine chart, which will slide
            up on click (discussed further in section "Minimum requirements"),
            and render the wine chart in full.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Show wine chart</h3>
          <p>
            This is merely an extension of the previous "view", as this is just
            an extra block sliding into view, showing the wine chart. 
          </p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Order table</h3>
          <p>
            This part of the page will have a white block containing form inputs
            for relevant information associated with ordering of a table at a
            restaurant; name, how many the table should be reserved for, phone
            number, and a date. Upon submitting the form, the user will be
            prompted with either a success, or a failure, depending on the
            validity of the input. If no errors are encountered, the form inputs
            will slide out of view, and a success message will be shown in place
            of the inputs.
          </p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Map and footer</h3>
          <p>
            On the bottom of the page you will encounter a map, followed by a
            small footer. The map will show the location of the restaurant, and
            will be an embedded Google Maps widget. The footer will simply be a
            list of contact information for the restaurant.
          </p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Minimum requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lazy loading of images. To improve the loading time of the
            application, we will not load any images except the banner image on
            initial load, but instead load them asynchronously with JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Animations: We will use JavaScript for a number of animations on our
            site. For example, when the user clicks or hovers seasons in season
            select, or when pulling up the wine chart. Without the animations
            the site will feel static and low-effort, and due to our primary
            target audience being high-class, we need to provide the best
            possible impression.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrolling: By tapping into the event listener for scrolling we can
            override the default scroll system and make our own. This will make
            sure that we can tailor the experience for each of the sections to
            present the restaurant in a satisfactory manner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scroll indicators: With JavaScript we will make scroll indicators
            with fixed position that show which page the user is currently on.
            One function that takes the number of the views the user is
            currently on and switches up which indicator, or dot, is highlighted
            will be sufficient to relay the desired information. We need to
            ensure this function is always called when the view changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Form feedback: We will use JavaScript to evaluate the authenticity
            of form input data client-side before it is sent to the imaginary
            server. This validation is very important to protect the server from
            malicious attacks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Plan</h2>
        <p>
          We believe working as a group produces the best overall result because
          it gives a more consistent styling and wording. Thus, no files will be
          made solely by one person. However, we will divide the website into
          several sections. Each section will have one person responsible for
          assuring optimal quality of the section. All the files and subfolders
          will be gathered inside this folder:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>index.html</li>
          <li>images/</li>
          <ul>
            <li>frontpage.mp4</li>
            <li>frontpage.png</li>
            <li>logo.png</li>
            <li>seasons/</li>
            <ul>
              <li>spring.png</li>
              <li>summer.png</li>
              <li>fall.png</li>
              <li>winter.png</li>
            </ul>
            <li>tableReservation.png</li>
          </ul>
          <li>css/</li>
          <ul>
            <li>style.css</li>
          </ul>
          <li>scripts/</li>
          <ul>
            <li>script.js</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The final project is due November 11th. To ensure a high quality of
          the website we believe it is important to start early and to have a
          good plan for the development of each section. We have set a deadline
          for each section and a person responsible for that particular section.
          The first sub project is to finish the html document. This will
          provide an overview of the whole page. Then basic css and hijack
          scrolling should be implemented to get an impression of how the final
          website will look. Then we will finish the styling, the animations and
          the scrollbar. Finally we must find or record video and images. The
          images may be taken from a royalty-free website.
