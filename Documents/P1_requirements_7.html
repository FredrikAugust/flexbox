        <h2>Administrative details</h2>
        <h4>Name of client</h4>
        <p>
          Góðr fæða is the restaurant which is our client, and we communicate
          directly with this imaginary company (ie. we do not have a contact
          person).

      <div class="purpose-and-goals">
        <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of the website is to provide a pleasant first impression to
          the users of the website (and potential customers of the restaurant).
          As well as that, we would like to provide a simle interface for
          viewing the food menu, as well as the wine chart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like to accomplish this by implementing a simple website with
          only one page (single page aplpication), where the information is
          provided in a logical way, so they are encouraged to read the entire
          page. To elaborate on the previous point, there should also be a
          minimal amount of text, so that the user does not get bored, though
          enough to explain unclear points.
        </p>

      <div class="audience">
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The target audience for this restaurant is middle to upper class
          citizens whowish to have a great meal for a not-so affordable price.
          They will visit thewebsite to either check out the menu and/or wine
          chart, reserve a table, orjust get information about the restaurant in
          general
